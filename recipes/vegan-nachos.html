        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>I am here to proclaim that nachos are a meal. While nachos are typically served as an appetizer or party snack, I like upgrading them to main dish status. With all of their toppings and textures, eating a dinner-sized helping is a thing I certainly have no problem with.</p>
        <p>These vegan nachos are inspired by Bar Amá’s and are fully loaded with toppings. Sure, you can serve them on game day or as a casual appetizer, but why not have a very fun nacho dinner at home?</p>
