        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Pot roasts typically use the tougher cuts of beef—a chuck roast or shoulder roast—which have the most flavor. Slow cooking at low heat is what melts the tough connective tissue between the muscle fibers, leaving you with tender meat that pulls apart with your fork.</p>
        <p>The result? A deeper beef flavor for your pot roast. The key is keeping the temperature low and making sure the lid is tight fitting. Otherwise, too much vapor will escape from the pot and you'll have a dry pot roast.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>3.5 pounds of beef shoulder</li>
